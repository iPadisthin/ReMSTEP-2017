    <h2>Why introduce this new unit?</h2>
    <p><strong>EDF5674</strong> has been designed for Master of Teaching and Master of Education students who wish to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gain a richer understanding of science as it is actually practiced across a range of contemporary scientific settings</li>
        <li>Improve their teaching and enhance their science communication by incorporating knowledge of contemporary scientific practices into their classrooms</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>What is involved?</h2>
    <p>The unit is delivered in collaboration with the Faculties of Education and Science.</p>
    <div class="activities">
        <h3>EDF5674 students will:</h3>
        <ul class="activity-list">
            <li>Undertake a number of investigative tasks which will help them to engage with science as it is practiced in contemporary scientific settings, involving: 
                <ul class="icon-list">
                    <li class="shadow wow zoomIn" data-wow-offset="100"><span>shadowing scientists in their workplace to observe the nature of their work;</span></li>
                    <li class="interview wow zoomIn" data-wow-offset="100"><span>interviewing scientists to explore their understandings of science; and</span></li>
                    <li class="talks wow zoomIn" data-wow-offset="100"><span>attendance at scientific conferences, symposia and other science media and communication events.</span></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Students are encouraged to understand, analyse and critique these practices in the context of classroom science teaching and explore ways of making the science experiences for their students more relevant and engaging. The unit will also help students to develop a framework that will enable them to better understand the dynamic nature of contemporary scientific practice, and to translate such practices into more engaging and authentic experiences in their classroom teaching.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Unit learning outcomes</h2>
    <p>Upon successful completion of the unit students should be able to:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>articulate how they have extended their current knowledge skills and abilities needed as a science educator</li>
        <li>demonstrate an understanding of the ways in which science responds to technological and social change</li>
        <li>demonstrate engagement with the contemporary practices of science, and</li>
        <li>demonstrate the connections between contemporary science practices and one’s educational practice.</li>
    </ol>  


    <h2>What does assessment involve?</h2>
    <aside class="right well" style="min-width: 400px;">
        <figure>
            <img src="/img/stem-hero.jpg" alt="">
            <figcaption>Images and representations of contemporary science are explored in the unit.</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </aside>
    <p>The unit assessment consists of two tasks designed to encourage students to reflect on their science workplace visits and new understandings of science practice. The first task involves the <strong>production of a multimedia representation</strong> which identifies and examines the contemporary knowledge skills and abilities needed in science education.</p>
    <p>The second task is a <strong>written assignment</strong> that requires students to connects their understanding of contemporary science practices with their classroom practices.</p>
    <h2>What is the workload like?</h2>
    <p>EDF5674 This is a <strong>12 point unit</strong> with a minimum total expected workload equivalent to <strong>288 hours per semester</strong>, comprising a mix of <strong>12 workshop hours</strong> and an additional <strong>24 hours of online activities</strong> over the semester.</p>
    <p><strong>The remaining hours</strong> are used to plan and attend a range of contemporary sciences workplaces to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>explore</li>
        <li>conduct interviews</li>
        <li>observe workplace practices</li>
        <li>undertake independent study</li>
        <li>read the recommended readings</li>
        <li>develop and complete responses to the required unit assessment tasks.</li>
    </ul>
