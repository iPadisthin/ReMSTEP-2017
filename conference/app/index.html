                                <p>The importance of effective learning in science and mathematics by primary school students is widely acknowledged. How can pre-service teachers best be prepared to enable this and improve their impact on science and mathematics education in primary school teaching environments?</p>
                                <p>This session explores the opportunities and challenges of several approaches to science specialisations within primary pre-service programs in various regional and metropolitan settings. Our improved understandings of effective practices through the ReMSTEP opportunity is summarised, and illuminated with case studies illustrating different approaches. These include our preparation of STEM education specialists who may better enable the integration of STEM education within the current curriculum expectations;  and leveraging the support of partnerships with diverse external facilities.</p>

                                <p>Increasing incidence of interactions between the scientific community and schools has flowed from a concern to increase students’ engagement with STEM. Students interacting with scientists and mathematicians can inspire and enrich their experience and their knowledge of creative practices in the STEM fields.</p>
                                <p>This session will describe a range of models linking pre-service teachers (PSTs) with scientists engaged in cutting edge research, as a way of introducing them to contemporary science concepts and practices, and scientists’ lives, and to explore ways of incorporating these innovations into school science.</p>
                                <p>Findings will be presented of the resources developed, outcomes for PSTs and scientists, and challenges for creating productive interactions. Discussion in the session will centre on the implications of these experiences and findings for schools.</p>

                                <p>One of the challenges of teaching science is how to represent contemporary advances and controversial issues in the curriculum. Stem cells are now key knowledge under cell growth and cell differentiation in the Biology Unit 2 Study Design.</p>
                                <p>This presentation will introduce and illustrate a range of activities and resources around the teaching of stem cells that were developed by pre-service teachers (PSTs) and teacher educators with the cooperation of a scientist working in the area. These activities draw on contemporary pedagogies such as the use of drama designed to engage students in dealing with scientific practices and ideas as well as stem cell related controversy.</p>
