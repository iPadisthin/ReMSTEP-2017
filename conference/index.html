    <h2 class="centered">Overview</h2>
    <div class="middle container large-text">   
        <p>The key innovation underpinning ReMSTEP is the exploration of ways of linking pre-service teachers to practising scientists and mathematicians, in order to represent the creativity and drive of scientific and mathematical thinking for these future teachers.</p>

        <p>This agenda is part of a wider movement in Australia and internationally to bring school STEM practices closer to the way STEM is practised professionally.</p>

        <p>A large part of this agenda is to make STEM subjects more relevant and engaging, and to better promote the thinking needed for effective participation in 21st century Australia.</p>

        <p>The experience of ReMSTEP is thus very relevant for pioneering innovative teaching practices that engage school students in quality science and mathematics learning.</p>

                            <h3>Part 1</h3>
                            <p>The importance of effective learning in science and mathematics by primary school students is widely acknowledged. How can pre-service teachers best be prepared to enable this and improve their impact on science and mathematics education in primary school teaching environments?</p>
                            <p>This session explores the opportunities and challenges of several approaches to science specialisations within primary pre-service programs in various regional and metropolitan settings. Our improved understandings of effective practices through the ReMSTEP opportunity is summarised, and illuminated with case studies illustrating different approaches. These include our preparation of STEM education specialists who may better enable the integration of STEM education within the current curriculum expectations;  and leveraging the support of partnerships with diverse external facilities.</p>

                            <h3>Part 1</h3>
                            <p>Increasing incidence of interactions between the scientific community and schools has flowed from a concern to increase students’ engagement with STEM. Students interacting with scientists and mathematicians can inspire and enrich their experience and their knowledge of creative practices in the STEM fields.</p>
                            <p>This session will describe a range of models linking pre-service teachers (PSTs) with scientists engaged in cutting edge research, as a way of introducing them to contemporary science concepts and practices, and scientists’ lives, and to explore ways of incorporating these innovations into school science.</p>
                            <p>Findings will be presented of the resources developed, outcomes for PSTs and scientists, and challenges for creating productive interactions. Discussion in the session will centre on the implications of these experiences and findings for schools.</p>

                            <p>This innovation is about integrating the specialist knowledge of practicing scientists, researchers and STEM specialists into the school curriculum and teacher classroom practice with the aim to create greater engagement and subject relevance for students.</p>
                            <p>A range of approaches will be described that provide pre-service teachers (PSTs) greater competence and confidence in their teaching of science and mathematics.</p>
                            <p>In particular, two case studies will be presented that will demonstrate PSTs interacting and learning about contemporary science and maths practices.</p>

                            <p>One of the challenges of teaching science is how to represent contemporary advances and controversial issues in the curriculum. Stem cells are now key knowledge under cell growth and cell differentiation in the Biology Unit 2 Study Design.</p>
                            <p>This presentation will introduce and illustrate a range of activities and resources around the teaching of stem cells that were developed by pre-service teachers (PSTs) and teacher educators with the cooperation of a scientist working in the area. These activities draw on contemporary pedagogies such as the use of drama designed to engage students in dealing with scientific practices and ideas as well as stem cell related controversy.</p>

                            <p>As an exemplar, ‘Reconceptualising Rocks’ involved PSTs working with Melbourne Museum scientists and teacher educators to explore the science of geology and the role of the museum in conservation and communication.

                            <p><strong>Jan van Driel</strong> is a professor of science education at Melbourne Graduate School of Education, University of Melbourne, Australia. He did a PhD (1990) on teaching and learning of chemical equilibrium. In the last 15 years, his research focused on the knowledge base of science teachers. Among others, he conducted a series of studies on the practical knowledge of science teachers about the teaching and learning of models and modeling in science education. In several studies, the focus was on the emerging pedagogical content knowledge of pre-service science teachers about models and modeling. Other studies focused on the knowledge and beliefs of experienced science teachers and were carried out in the context of curriculum innovation in Dutch secondary education, and in the context of university teaching of science. He published extensively about these studies together with international colleagues and PhD students. Recently, Jan co-wrote a chapter ‘Research on Science Teacher Knowledge’ in the Handbook of Research in Science Education (2nd ed., Routledge, 2014). Currently, he is co-editor-in-Chief of the International Journal of Science Education.</p>
