        <p>At the Melbourne Museum, the world class scientist Dermot Henry, who manages the Natural Science Collections, taught me that rocks are alive and have their own story, going back millions and millions of years. The “Reconceptualising Rocks” program was so much fun that I came back for its second consecutive year! The passion and enthusiasm of the scientists and educators helped me see that the Earth is much more than just a big rock.</p>

    <p class="intro">Reconceptualising Rocks is a program designed in collaboration between Melbourne Museum, Deakin University and the University of Melbourne. The program connects pre-service teachers to scientists, contemporary science, and museum pedagogy practices for the learning and teaching of Earth Science.</p>
    <p>This initiative responds to ReMSTEP Innovation 4 – Specialist Science and Technology Centre Collaborations. The Reconceptualising Rocks program enables the provision of an additional experience for pre-service teachers.</p>
    <p>The goals of the program are to improve the competence and confidence of participating pre-service teachers in the teaching of Earth Science. The participants’ content and pedagogy knowledge is enhanced by connecting them to scientists, contemporary science and museum education practices.</p>
    <p>Melbourne Museum acts as a contextual setting for the project, providing expertise as a key communicator of science in Victoria and a contemporary site for learning.</p>

    <h2>Collaborative program development approach</h2>
    <p>The project team developed a learning experience for pre-service teachers utilising a wide range of multi-disciplinary expertise: science education, museum-based pedagogies, curriculum development, educational design and contemporary geology research and scientific practice.</p>
    <p>The program was promoted to pre-service teachers through the Master of Teaching (Science) at the Melbourne Graduate School of Education and through the Community Science Project unit at Deakin University. Subject coordinators were actively involved in planning and promoting of the program.</p>
    <p>Approximately 40 pre-service teachers participated in the program in 2015.</p>
    <p>The program included 2 days on-site at Melbourne Museum and a 1 day field trip to geologically rich sites in Victoria (Phillip Island in March and Hanging Rock State Park in July). Dermot Henry, Manager Natural Sciences Collections and Priscilla Gaff, Program Coordinator Life Sciences facilitated on-site sessions and field trips.</p>
    <p>One of the highlights was the back of house tour at the museum, where pre-service teachers were able to hear from and engage with the curators and collection managers in small groups. There was also an opportunity to take photographs and film various collection specimens to use in research and assessment tasks.</p>
    <p>Another highlight was the field trip to explore the geology of Phillip Island and Hanging Rock State Park. Over a number of stops, the pre-service teachers got an opportunity to explore unique key geological principals of both locations, linking the knowledge they’ve acquired on site at the Museum to a context of a living breathing landscape.</p>
    <p>Throughout the program, pre-service teachers had an opportunity to expand their knowledge of geology and contextual learning at the museum. Learning experience included: expert guidance and exploration sessions at the Dynamic Earth gallery, participation in the Rocks-Camera-Action education program designed for Year 8 students and a number of group activities such as mind-mapping, production of digital resources for teaching, mini-lectures from the Museum staff and hands-on activities.</p>

        <h2>Program outline</h2>
        <p>The 2015 program was delivered to a combined group of pre-service teachers from both Deakin University and the University of Melbourne.</p>
        <p>The 2015 July program was delivered over four days, three half-day sessions at Melbourne Museum and a one day field trip.</p>

                <p>To give the participating pre-service teachers an insight into the program rock specimens from the Museum collection were handed out and each participant was asked to look at the rock, describe it and express what they thought the story of the rock might be.</p>

                <p>The museum staff provided an overview of the Museum in order to give an insight into the role of the Museum collection in contemporary scientific research.</p>
                <p><strong>Priscilla Gaff</strong>, Program Coordinator – Life Sciences, discussed the Museum's purpose and its role in Science and Education, how the participants would contibute to the Museum educational outputs and how this linked to the goals of ReMSTEP.</p>
                <p><strong>Dermot Henry</strong> – Manager Natural Science Collections, then gave an insight into the significance of the collection with his talk, <i>Why the geology focus: Old rocks – who needs them</i>.</p>

                <h3>What do you know?</h3>

                <p>The participants undertook a mind-mapping exercise to establish their current knowledge of rocks and geology. They asked to observe a rock and incorporate what they notice into their mind map.</p>
                <p>The AusVELS curriculum content description for Science / Level 8 / Science Understanding / Earth and space sciences was used a guide: <i>Sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic rocks contain minerals and are formed by processes that occur within Earth over a variety of timescales</i>.</p>
                <p>The participants were then asked to discuss how they would use the mind-map approach in their own teaching.</p>
                <p>Finally they were given more information about their rock.</p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>

            <p>As with any program of this nature, there were also some challenges. In particular, scheduling and timetabling was particularly difficult, due to variations in study periods at Deakin University and the University of Melbourne. In 2016, the program is delivered separately to pre-service teachers from Deakin University and the University of Melbourne, to avoid to scheduling difficulties.</p>

            <h2>Feedback</h2>

            <p>Despite the challenges, feedback from the participants has been very positive; pre-service teachers appreciate the rare opportunity to increase their knowledge of Earth Science and produce engaging teaching resources for Level 8 Earth Science curriculum.</p>

            <h2>Outcomes and implications for future development</h2>
            <p>This program impacts on pre-service teachers’ understanding of Earth Science and the work of the scientists in this area. It provides them with new and exciting ways to translate science ideas and practices for educational purposes.</p>
            <p>Evaluation to date showed that the pre-service teachers found the experience interesting and engaging. Even with no prior knowledge in this area, the participants were able to link Earth Science to other areas of science, find ways to communicate their ideas and create engaging lesson plans and associated resources. As part of the Reconceptualising Rocks experiences, the participants were also able to gain an insight into the role of the museum as a rich resource for educators.</p>
