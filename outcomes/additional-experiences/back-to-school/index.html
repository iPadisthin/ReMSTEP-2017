    <p>Have you ever wished you could go back into the classroom and see your teachers with new eyes? Back To School, a ReMSTEP activity from the University of Melbourne, sought to give this opportunity to science undergraduates, to show them how a modern classroom operates, and encourage them to pursue teaching careers. </p>

    <p>This two-day program ran in 2015 and 2016 and brought together 15 science undergraduates and 15 pre-service teachers (PSTs) from the University of Melbourne.The aim of the program was for science undergraduates to learn about teaching, and for PSTs to learn about teaching science.</p>

    <p>On the first day, pairs or PSTs and undergraduates were to plan lessons on a science topic set by the placement schools, East Bentleigh Primary School and Bentleigh Secondary College. The PSTs assisted the undergraduates to understand teaching concepts and educational principles. On the second day, in-service teachers, observed by the science undergraduates and PSTs, delivered the planned lessons to their student.</p>
    
    <p>By bringing these two groups together, this activity sought to bridge the widening gap between those who learn science and those who teach it. For many science undergraduates, this was their first experience planning and teaching a class. In breaking down the higher concepts into basic terms, they both deepened their understanding of them, and highlighted to the PSTs the process needed to teach them. They developed new perspectives of mathematics in the teaching context, touched on theories on teaching and learnt a package of teaching skills, such as creating safe environment, selecting appropriate assessment, and identifying misconceptions.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Normally, teachers are standing up so they are looking down at their students. But the teacher in the class that I observed, he said try to get down to the same level with the students. To me that showed how the teacher could build a closer relationship with the students. It showed me a different perspective than I'm used and that teaching done differently can be done in a way that makes a difference. That's encouraging to me.</p>

        </blockquote>
    </div>
    
    <p>For the PSTs, many had not formally learned about science since high school, citing negative experience with dry lessons and teachers as the reason. By combining their knowledge of teaching with the undergraduates’ knowledge of science, they learned about the science topics while critically thinking about the techniques needed to teach them.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <blockquote>
            <p>What I took away from this experience was that when students have to actually think about how to teach someone else they really come to understand what they know and don't know. They actually have to get down to the nuts and bolts of what they are working with in order to be able to teach their fellow students.</p>

    <p>The experience was described as “eye-opening” by both the undergraduate science students and the PSTs. During the program, both groups had opportunity to talk and network with the staff of the placement schools, and some created friendships that will serve them well as they enter the workforce.</p>
    
    <div class="row">
        <blockquote>
            <p>I think it is important that our students go through as many experiences as possible before they decide what type of teacher they want to be&hellip; The whole experience was about&hellip; allowing them to re-conceptualise what Mathematics and Science classrooms are like from when they were students themselves.</p>

        </blockquote>
    </div>
    
    <p>By coming back to school, the PSTs gained a personal experience in teaching mathematics and science, while the undergraduates got to see what happens behind the scenes of teaching. Having seen what what school teaching in Australia was really like, they have also become potential spokespeople for careers in maths and science teaching in their student communities.</p>
