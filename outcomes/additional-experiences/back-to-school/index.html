    <h2>Back to school</h2>
    <p>Have you ever wished you could go back in time? Back to School, a ReMSTEP activity run by Associate Professor Wee Tiong at the University of Melbourne in 2015 and 2016, aims to do just that.</p>

    <p>The program brought together 15 science undergraduates and 15 pre-service teachers (PSTs) from the University of Melbourne. They were to plan a lesson for a placement class, which would then delivered by the science students.</p>

    <p>Not only were the PSTs teaching someone how to teach, but they were also learning and thinking about science. For many PSTs, this was their first time learning science since high school, where they may have had a negative experience.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>What I took away from this experience was that when students have to actually think about how to teach someone else they really come to understand what they know and don't know. They actually have to get down to the nuts and bolts of what they are working with in order to be able to teach their fellow students.</p>

    <p>For many science students, this was their first experience planning and teaching a class. In breaking down the higher concepts into basic terms, they both deepened their understanding of them, and highlighted to the PSTs the process needed to teach them.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Normally, teachers are standing up so they are looking down at their students. But the teacher in the class that I observed, he said try to get down to the same level with the students. To me that showed how the teacher could build a closer relationship with the students. It showed me a different perspective than I'm used and that teaching done differently can be done in a way that makes a difference. That's encouraging to me.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>I think it is important that our students go through as many experiences as possible before they decide what type of teacher they want to be... The whole experience was about... allowing them to re-conceptualise what Mathematics and Science classrooms are like from when they were students themselves.</p>
