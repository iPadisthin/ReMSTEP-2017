    <h2>Back to school</h2>
    <p>Have you ever wished you could go back in time? Back to School, a ReMSTEP activity run at the University of Melbourne by Associate Professor Wee Tiong Seah, aimed to do just that.</p>

    <p>The program ran in 2016 and 2017, bringing together 15 science undergraduates and 15 pre-service teachers (PSTs) each year from the University of Melbourne. They were to plan lessons on a science topic, which would then delivered by the science undergraduates to  East Bentleigh Primary School and Bentleigh Secondary College. The aim of the day: for PSTs to learn about science, and for science undergraduates to learn about teaching.</p>

    <p>By bringing these two groups together, this activity sought to bridge the widening gap between those who learn science and those who teach it. For many science undergraduates, this was their first experience planning and teaching a class. In breaking down the higher concepts into basic terms, they both deepened their understanding of them, and highlighted to the PSTs the process needed to teach them.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Normally, teachers are standing up so they are looking down at their students. But the teacher in the class that I observed, he said try to get down to the same level with the students. To me that showed how the teacher could build a closer relationship with the students. It showed me a different perspective than I'm used and that teaching done differently can be done in a way that makes a difference. That's encouraging to me.</p>

    <p>For the PSTs, many had not formally learned about science since high school, citing negative experience with dry lessons and teachers as the reason. By combining their knowledge of teaching with the undergraduates’ knowledge of science, they learned about the science topics while critically thinking about the techniques needed to teach them.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <blockquote>
            <p>What I took away from this experience was that when students have to actually think about how to teach someone else they really come to understand what they know and don't know. They actually have to get down to the nuts and bolts of what they are working with in order to be able to teach their fellow students.</p>

    <p>The experience was described as “eye-opening” by both the undergraduate science students and the PSTs. During the program, both groups had opportunity to talk and network with the staff of the placement schools, and some created friendships that will serve them well as they enter the workforce.</p>
    
    <div class="row">
        <blockquote>
            <p>I think it is important that our students go through as many experiences as possible before they decide what type of teacher they want to be... The whole experience was about... allowing them to re-conceptualise what Mathematics and Science classrooms are like from when they were students themselves.</p>
